## Unofficial mirror of the Vicon DataStream SDK
This is an unofficial repository for the Vicon DataStream SDK source code (available under the MIT licence). The official website is [here](https://www.vicon.com/products/software/datastream-sdk).

This repository was created in order to make it easier to build the SDK from source and to remove the bundled Boost libraries (which means you must have the required Boost libraries and headers installed on your system). It also allows for easier embedding as a git submodule.

The upstream version number for the code is v1.8.0\_105615h (retrieved Nov 1 2018).
